I’m thrilled to announce a new chapter in my professional journey! After years of working in data and technology, I’m transitioning my career to focus on **building open-source tools** that help bridge **natural language** and **data science**. 

I’ve noticed how often teams struggle to turn plain-text questions or ideas into meaningful data insights. Whether it’s writing complicated SQL or wrestling with advanced analytics libraries, there’s a significant gap between asking the question and getting the answer. That’s where my new work comes in: creating intuitive, open-source solutions that let people query and analyze data **in the same way they speak**—no advanced technical expertise required.

By making these tools open source, I’m hoping to foster collaboration and community-driven innovation. My goal is to empower data scientists, developers, and anyone with a question to quickly gain insights without complex code or steep learning curves.

I’m excited to dive deeper into this mission, and I’d love to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, open-source advocates, and anyone curious about unlocking the power of natural language interfaces. Let’s work together to make data science more accessible, one query at a time!
